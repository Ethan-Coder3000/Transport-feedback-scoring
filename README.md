# Transport-feedback-scoring

There are a multitude of things that influences the daily experience of commuters on
public transport - congestion and disruptions being the major ones. We believe that
there are other less visible influences that have significant impacts too.
WhereIsMyTransport strives to “make the invisible visible” through data, and we have
collected some anonymous route sentiment scores. Your task is to summarise these
scores and see if they can help us in identifying other influences.
